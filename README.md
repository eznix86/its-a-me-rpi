# It's-a Me, Raspberry Pi!

I made it because I didn't label my Pis, and it was a pain to tell them apart. Now, you can just run the script and instantly know which one is which.

Productive laziness it is.

The pattern lights the ACT to the sound of "It's-a me" from Super Mario.

## Usage

Run this command on your Raspberry Pi:

```sh
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eznix86/its-a-me-rpi/main/me.sh | bash
```
